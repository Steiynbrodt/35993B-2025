35993B Code of Conduct
1. Respect and Collaboration

Members treat each other with respect, patience, and professionalism.
Every contribution — code, testing, building, or ideas — is valued.
We work as a team, we communicate clearly, and we support each other.

2. Quality Standards

All code in this repository must be:

Understandable

Reviewed

Tested on the robot (where applicable)

Documented where needed

We prioritize reliability, readability, and safety.

3. “Vibe Coding” Policy

This project supports creative problem-solving, rapid prototyping, and intuitive coding — commonly known as “vibe coding.”
Vibe coding is allowed, under the following conditions:

✔ Allowed When:

The contributor understands the code they wrote

The code is explainable to another team member

The code goes through review by at least one other person

The code does not introduce unclear hacks or silent side effects

The final version is cleaned up, even if the first draft wasn’t

❌ Not Allowed When:

Code is copied without understanding

Logic is added that “just works somehow” with no explanation

Implementation relies on chance, glitches, undefined behavior, or untested assumptions

Comments, documentation, or review are skipped

Changes break existing functionality without communication

In short:

You may vibe code, but not blindly.
Creativity is welcome; confusion is not.

4. Review Requirements

Before being merged or used in competition:

Every change must be reviewed by at least one teammate

Reviewers can request revisions or explanation

Significant changes should be tested physically when possible

Unsafe code or code that cannot be explained will not be accepted

Review is collaborative, not adversarial.

5. Communication Expectations

Members should:

Communicate blockers or issues early

Use clear commit messages

Document unexpected behavior or important implementation details

Coordinate before large changes

6. Safety and Robotics

Because this code runs on hardware:

No untested movement code should be run without safe setup

Autonomous routines must be verified in a safe environment

Code that can cause unsafe behavior must be fixed immediately or rolled back


7. Inclusivity

All team members — regardless of experience — may contribute.
Learning is encouraged. Questions are welcome.
No one should feel intimidated or excluded.

8. Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

Request for revision

Review freeze

Temporary removal of privileges

Reversion of unsafe or unclear changes

Decisions are made based on code quality, safety, and teamwork.

9. Final Notes

This Code of Conduct is designed to make the team efficient, safe, and collaborative — while still allowing creativity, experimentation, and the freedom to write code in your own style, as long as the team understands it and it goes through review.
